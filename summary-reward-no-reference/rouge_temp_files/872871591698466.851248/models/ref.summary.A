Untreated diabetes is said to be the reason for abu-jama 's hospitalization last week. The letters were delivered by Johanna Fernandez , a professor of history at Baruch College , according to Education Action Group News. ' We shared a touching moment with Mumia in an effort to raise his spirits , ' Fernandez reported. ' Two teachers delivered letters to us that their students had written to Mumia. ' ' It had been a long time since we had seen Mumia smile. ' He chuckled as he read excerpts from these touching letters. ' The letters themselves or what they said were not released. However the fact they were written and then sent has infuriated many. Richard Costello , political coordinator for the Philadelphia Fraternal Order of police , said the letters set a dangerous example. ' I think its both alarming and outrageous that any teacher would use a group of innocent seven-year-olds to promote a twisted agenda glorifying murder , glorifying hatred and glorifying violence , ' Costello told Fox News. ' He Shot ( the officer ) in the back and then as the officer lay slumped against a wall helpless he leaned over and shot him between the eyes. ' When he was in the hospital he actually bragged about it. ' Controversial : Marylin Zunig , a teacher at Forest Street School in Orange , New Jersey , had her third graders wrote letters to Mumia abu-jamal. The letters have subsequently sparked outrage. Costello said all the teachers involved in the letter writing campaign should be fired. ' Furthermore all the parents who have children in that school system need to reevaluate that involvement , because these children are now placed in danger by the very people charged with their education , ' Costello said. ' They are being used as tools in someone 's twisted agenda. ' Costello has previously described abu-jamal as ' the devil '. The official reason the convicted killer was hospitalized has not been released. However reports say he was suffering high blood sugar levels. Attorney Bret grote with the pittsburgh-based abolitionist law center said last week that his client was placed in the critical care unit of Schuylkill Medical Center in Pottsville , Pennsylvania. GROTE says neither he nor abu-jamal 's brother , Keith Cook , had been allowed in to see him. ' We 're concerned , about as concerned as it gets , about Mumia 's health , ' grote told the Philadelphia Inquirer.
