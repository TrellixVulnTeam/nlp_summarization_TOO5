New Delhi (CNN)In an unusual public raid in India, thousands stormed a jail and dragged out a rape suspect before beating him to death on the streets, authorities said Friday. The 35-year-old suspect, who was described as an illegal immigrant from Bangladesh, died from severe injuries before officers could rescue him, said L.L. Doungal, a police official in the remote Nagaland state, where the attack occurred Thursday evening. "There were thousands of them. Many of them were students in uniform," Doungal said, referring to the mobs involved in the incident. The suspect was accused of raping a local  woman last month. Since the attack,  tensions have grown between the native Nagas and Bangladeshi migrants in the district, police said. Thousands of protesters demanding cancellation of trade permits for Bengali-speaking settlers tore into the prison complex  Thursday and pulled out the suspect, Doungal said. Police initially used teargas and bamboo canes to rescue the man, but it didn't work, he said. "There were students in uniform. So, we had to use minimum force," Doungal added. Later, police opened fire, but it was too late to save the suspect. Protesters had planned a public hanging, but the suspect died from injuries in the attack,  according to authorities. "We retrieved his body before it could be hung," Doungal said. Dimapur town has been placed under a curfew. "The situation is still volatile," he said. India made international headlines this month when it banned a documentary  showing an interview with a convicted rapist, who blamed his victim and said she "should just be silent and allow the rape." Outrage has grown following the incident, which gives a window into the violence against women in the nation. The woman in the documentary incident was attacked by five men on a public bus in 2012. She later died from her injuries, sparking an outcry worldwide. New Delhi police said the interview was banned because of its potential to breed disorder.

(The Hollywood Reporter)Albert Maysles, who collaborated along with his late brother David in a documentary film career that included the troubling 1970 concert documentary "Gimme Shelter," has died. He was 88. The director and cinematographer, an Oscar nominee, died Thursday at his home in Manhattan of natural causes, Stacey Farrar, marketing director at the Maysles Center in New York, confirmed to The Hollywood Reporter. "Gimme Shelter" -- which chronicled the 1969 Rolling Stones tour that culminated in the Altamont Free Concert, in which a fan brandishing a gun was stabbed to death by a Hells Angels security man — stood in a stark and more enduring counterpoint to the myth of the documentary "Woodstock," a depiction of the glorified 1969 free concert whose own dark side was left out in its pre-conceived, celebratory style. Their most well-known film, "Grey Gardens" (1975), was a profile of Jacqueline Onassis' eccentric cousins -- mother and daughter Big Edie and Little Edie Bouvier -- who lived in a dilapidated, cat-packed estate in East Hampton, New York. The brothers worked with fellow directors Ellen Hovde and Muffie Meyer on the film, which was remade as a Tony-winning Broadway play and as an award-winning 2009 HBO drama that starred Drew Barrymore and Jessica Lange. Just prior to "Gimme Shelter," they filmed "Salesman" (1969), which covered six weeks in the lives of four door-to-door Bible salesmen. The brothers, who preferred the moniker of filmmaker rather than director, often focused on musical figures. Maysles was a cameraman on D.A. Pennebaker's "Monterey Pop" (1968), about the celebrated California music festival that featured electrifying performances from the likes of Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin. TCM Classic Film Fest: Albert Maysles on Freeing Cameras, Capturing Truths (Video) During that period of their career, they also collaborated on such direct cinemas as "What's Happening! The Beatles in the U.S.A." (1964), "With Love From Truman" (1966) and "Meet Marlon Brando" (1966), which premiered at the New York Film Festival. In 1968, they made "Vladimir Horowitz: The Last Romantic," and the following year, they shot "Horowitz Plays Mozart," also for TV. "People are people. We're out to discover what is going on behind the scenes and get as close as we can to what is happening," he said of their cinematic style. There were often emotional reactions to their films; fans applauded them for the trust they developed with their subjects, allowing them to reveal long-repressed feelings or telling insights. Their style -- with their subjects caught by a hand-held camera and shotgun mike -- was in the tradition of such documentarians as Frederick Wiseman. However, cinema verite "purists" argued that the Maysleses sometimes exploited the content, particularly in regard to the omniscient editing of "Gimme Shelter," where their flashback storytelling style created a dramatic foreboding and "imposed" a narrative on the Stones' tour. Flashbacking from Mick Jagger reviewing their footage, with Altamont's horrific memory in the recent past, "Gimme Shelter" punctuated a feeling of dread as the events moved inexorably to the tour's cataclysmic end. Originally, the "free concert" was planned to happen in San Francisco, but logistics went askew and it ended up at the Altamont Speedway in Northern California. Muddled by inadequate planning and the darkness at the fringes of the peace/love zeitgeist, the concert was a ghoulish nightmare. Admittedly, the Maysleses straddled a line between artistic license and nonfiction narrative. "Al and Dave often argue that all they're doing is filming what's there. The detail is comment: fingers scratching, soft focusing. A filmmaker is always making comments," cinematographer Haskell Wexler once opined in a Village Voice article. He and his brother, who died in January 1987 at age 55, received an Oscar nomination for the 28-minute short "Christo's Valley Curtain" (1974), about the artist's first public work. That year, Albert shot film of the Muhammad Ali-George Foreman 1974 heavyweight title bout in Zaire that would become the 1996 Oscar-winning documentary "When We Were Kings." Maysles won three Emmys, two for his work with his brother on "The Last Romantic" and "Soldiers of Music" (1991) and one for "Abortion: Desperate Choices" (1991). In 2001, he shot "Lalee's Kin: A Legacy of Cotton" for HBO, a depiction of rural poverty in the Mississippi Delta that he created with Susan Froemke and Deborah Dickson, with whom he also worked on "Desperate Choices." Maysles also filmed half-hour portraits of filmmakers including Martin Scorsese, Robert Duvall and Jane Campion, and he remained quite active in his later years. Hollywood's Notable Deaths of 2015 . He was born November 26, 1926, in Boston and raised in nearby Brookline, Massachusetts. He got a B.A. at Syracuse University and a masters at Boston University, where he subsequently taught. During World War II, he was stationed at the U.S. Army's Headquarters Intelligence School in Oberammergau, Germany. In the mid-1950s, Maysles traveled to Russia, where he made a 1955 film on mental health care and psychiatry in Russia. It was shown on NBC's "Today" show and by the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. In 1957, the brothers began working as a team. They traveled from Munich to Moscow by motorcycle and made a film about the Polish student revolution, 'Youth in Poland," which was televised by NBC. Next, they worked on an experimental TV project for Time Inc., with Maysles shooting Primary and Yanqui No! In 1962, they formed their own company. They made "Showman," a portrait of movie magnate Joseph E. Levine that brought them attention. The film was acclaimed on the festival circuit, but the Maysles dubbed it an "expensive resume." They subsequently won a Guggenheim Fellowship in Experimental Film. People we've lost in 2015 . ©2015 The Hollywood Reporter. All rights reserved.
(CNN)A Russian property developer, a Chinese outfit operating shell companies and Venezuelan officials ripping off the state-owned oil companies -- all of them are accused of coming to a bank in the European principality of Andorra to "wash" their money. Now the U.S. Treasury is casting a spotlight on the alleged misdeeds of senior managers at the Banca Privada d'Andorra (BPA), several of whom have been arrested in the past few days. The Treasury Department has alleged that "high-level managers [at BPA] accepted payments and other benefits from their criminal clients." The Andorran authorities took over the running of the bank after the Treasury revelations, and the director general of the Banca Privada, Joan Pau Miquel Prats, was arrested late Friday. Two more bank officials were arrested Sunday. Tiny Andorra, nestled in the rugged Pyrenees mountains, has two big neighbors. One is France. And the scandal has spread to its other neighbor, Spain, where corruption among public officials is a hot-button political issue. Prats had driven BPA's expansion into Spain, through its acquisition of Banco Madrid, in 2011. Banco Madrid caters to wealthy private clients and came under investigation by Spanish financial authorities last year. Since the BPA scandal broke, the commission that investigates illicit financial activity, Sepblac, has raised questions about accounts held by influential Spanish political and business figures at the Banco Madrid. They have not been named. The Central Bank has taken control of Banco Madrid and sent in two inspectors to examine accounts there. The bank's board, which included Prats and a former high-ranking official of the Central Bank, resigned on Thursday. Spanish officials say some 20 suspect operations at the bank are being examined. Spanish authorities are separately investigating substantial assets held at the Banca Privada d'Andorra by members of the Pujol family, who have long been prominent in the politics of Catalonia, a region of Spain that includes Barcelona. The director of the U.S. Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, Jennifer Shasky Calvery, said that "BPA's corrupt high-level managers and weak antimoney laundering controls have made BPA an easy vehicle for third-party money launderers to funnel proceeds of organized crime, corruption and human trafficking through the U.S. financial system." BPA has correspondent accounts with four banks -- HSBC, Citigroup, Bank of America and Deutsche Bank -- through which hundreds of millions of dollars passed. Senior managers at BPA tailored services to their clients to disguise the origin of funds, the Treasury said. One manager provided "substantial assistance" to a Russian client, Andrei Petrov, described by the Treasury as a "third-party money launderer working for Russian criminal organizations." Petrov had also received a line of credit from Banco Madrid and is alleged to have bribed local officials in the resort where he set up a property development company. He was arrested in Spain two years ago and is accused of helping launder some 56 million euros ($59 million) in proceeds from Russian criminal organizations. Petrov is yet to go on trial. According to the U.S. Treasury, Petrov has links with one of the FBI's most wanted fugitives, Simeon Mogilevich. BPA is also alleged to have helped Venezuelan money launderers siphon funds from the state-owned oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela. "This money-laundering network worked closely with high-ranking government officials in Venezuela, resident agents in Panama, and an Andorran lawyer to establish Panamanian shell companies," the Treasury said. BPA processed about $2 billion in transactions by shell companies related to the scheme. Treasury said another senior official at BPA accepted bribes in return for processing bulk cash transfers for a Chinese money launderer, Gao Ping, who was arrested in Spain in September 2012. "Through his associate, Ping bribed Andorran bank officials to accept cash deposits into less scrutinized accounts and transfer the funds to suspected shell companies in China," it said in a statement. Credit rating agency Standard & Poor's has reacted to the growing scandal by downgrading Andorra's rating. Andorra is highly dependent on its banking sector, which makes up some 20% of its GDP. Spain has long battled the presence of Russian organized crime on its soil. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, wealthy Russians came to Spain for its climate and what were then lax financial controls. Among them were more than a few "vory v zakone," the top echelon of Russian organized crime, according to Spanish officials. Spanish prosecutor Jose Grinda Gonzalez told U.S. officials five years ago that these individuals had no known jobs and unknown sources of income, yet they lived in large mansions. Grinda's remarks were reported in a diplomatic cable later published by WikiLeaks. Grinda had prosecuted Zakhar Kalashov, a Georgian-born, Russian citizen widely regarded as one of the most powerful figures in the Russian mafia. Last year, before he completed his nine-year sentence, a Spanish appeals court deported Kalashov to Russia, where he is now a free man. Another Spanish prosecutor, Fernando Bermejo, told US officials in 2009 that there was large scale money-laundering going on in Catalonia and "many, many" members of the Russian mafia were active there. Because of growing international cooperation, Spanish prosecutors have stepped up their pursuit of alleged gang leaders, money launderers and embezzlers from Eastern Europe. Among the latest to be detained is a former finance minister from Ukraine, Yuriy Kolobov. He was detained at a luxury development in Alicante earlier this month, after prosecutors in Kiev charged him with embezzlement and is awaiting extradition. Kolobov was a minister in the government of President Viktor Yanukovych, who fled Ukraine during street protests a year ago. Helena Cavendish de Moura contributed to this report .
(CNN)Five Muslim women stand tall in a boxing ring, slowly winding strapping around their hands. A spotlight is trained on them and the audience draws close, hanging on their every word. "How can we be truthful if we have to hide out of shame, feel humiliated for feeling, for saying, doing, thinking as we please? How can that be freedom, how can that be truth?" Performed at Southbank Centre's WOW -- Women of the World Festival -- Common Wealth Theatre's "No Guts, No Heart, No Glory," tells the true story of Muslim female boxers from Bradford in the north of England, and how they are using the sport to transcend religious and gender barriers. The critically acclaimed show -- in which the women stamp, dance, shout, swear, punch, and even crowd surf -- was partly inspired by Ambreen Sadiq, a former UK national champion, and one of Britain's first Muslim female boxers. Her journey to success wasn't easy -- as a victim of bullying at the age of 13 she found respite in boxing after being introduced to it by her father and brother. "I got bullied quite a lot growing up, my dad's Pakistani and my mum's Portuguese," Sadiq told CNN. "I got stick from both sides, from white and black people. I felt like I wasn't accepted. I used to move schools so many times just to feel accepted. "People would stay stuff about how I looked... everyone said that's a boy's sport, what are you doing that for? You're going to look like a man, like a transsexual. "I was bullied from such a young age, I felt like it was never going to stop. Boxing helped me to control that anger." It was a transformative experience for Sadiq -- she went from being quiet, having few friends and getting into fights to plucking up courage to start conversations, and thereby build self confidence. "Instead of punching someone in the face I'd punch the bag," she added. "If anyone came up to me and said anything I could just walk away from it -- whereas before I'd just straight punch them in the face or something. So it's helped me a lot with discipline." It's sometimes hard to imagine Sadiq as a boxer -- her movements are calm and assured, and a kind smile is never far from her lips. "Boxing has made me the person I am today, and I'm so proud of the person I am," said the 20-year-old trailblazer, who is now looked up to by girls from all kinds of communities wanting to follow in her footsteps. "I've had a lot of girls -- not just Asian girls -- coming up to me and asking, how do you stop people saying it's a boy's sport? How can you convince your parents to let you box?" While boxing for many is just a sport -- albeit a violent one -- when it comes to women and Muslims participating it can feel more like a cause, with Sadiq often finding herself explaining her motivation to girls. "What's the difference if a boy boxes or if a girl boxes? When we're in that ring we look like boxers -- we don't look like a girl or a boy. "You come into that gym, you come into that show, you come into that ring thinking I'm a boxer, not that I'm a girl or I'm a boy." The role of Nicola Adams -- the first ever female boxer to win an Olympic gold medal -- has also been key in the fight for acceptance. Sadiq tells the story of how several years ago her coach Alwyn Belcher, who also worked with Adams, originally refused to train women -- that is, until he turned up to coach the GB team (believing they'd be men) only to find an enthusiastic bunch of women ready to work. "That's the day he met Nicola Adams," recalls Sadiq with a laugh. "He said from that day he thought girls were better boxers -- because they like to listen." Since Adams' success at the Olympic Games, females boxing once a week increased by 79% according to a 2013 Sport England study, but even the production of "No Guts, No Heart, No Glory" highlighted the barriers women potentially face. Cast member and aspiring medical student Freyaa Ali said there was a girl who had wanted to participate in the show, but was ultimately prevented from doing so by her relatives. "It wasn't even the boxing and it wasn't even the speech, it was the dancing we do in the ring. I'm incredibly lucky to be able to do this, and I was just so sad for her. You know there are certain women out there who can't do what we're doing right now." "I think that's what makes me even more passionate about doing this -- we want to give them a voice and give them a reason, so they know they can have confidence to do stuff like this." If women do feel restricted by their religion or gender, Ali urged them to take things step by step. "Go for it, just go for it. I think maybe talk to your parents first, and just tell them Mum, Dad, this is what I want to do, I want to box, I want to dance, I want to act, or whatever she wants to do. "Tell them, you know what? Its OK what I'm doing, I'm not going to be going out of my boundaries and doing bad things, I'm going to stick to my limits and stick to my religion, it's not harming anyone. "My parents would say, if you're happy, we're happy. I think anyone's parents would say that wouldn't they? "The first step is trying it and opening that door. Once you can open it an inch you can open it a mile."
Perth, Australia (CNN)In the Swan Valley on the outskirts of Perth, a petite, blonde woman opens the front door. Dressed in skinny jeans, a gray t-shirt and black heels, Danica Weeks welcomes us inside her family home. Her warm smile and sparkly green eyes briefly disguise the deep-seated grief and sadness that constantly envelops her. The mother of two young boys can't move on. Her life is stuck on March 7, 2014, when she kissed her husband Paul goodbye at Perth International Airport. He was heading to Mongolia, where he would begin work as a mechanical engineer at one of the mines. It was a big job with enormous opportunity that could set up his young family. Unable to wear jewelry at the work site, he gave Danica his wedding band saying that if anything was to happen to him, she should give the ring to the first son that marries. Wearing it on a simple chain around her neck, she touches it as she speaks. "I'm so glad that happened, that I've got this for the boys," she said. "And for me, because I may never get anything. It may be the only piece of him that I have that is so close to us." Paul Weeks, 39, left Perth that day and flew to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, for his flight on to Beijing. Just after midnight on March 8, he boarded Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. Weeks had no idea about the plane's disappearance until she got a call from a news reporter asking if her husband was on board the missing Boeing 777. "My life stopped that day, so that's what I remember. I'm purely now just existing. People say you're coping. I wouldn't call it coping; it's existing." She has yet to tell her eldest son Lincoln, 4, that his father whom he adored will never come home. She can't make sense of it herself. How is a 4-year-old going to understand? She tells him Daddy is working in Mongolia -- the truth is just too painful. "You create your own scenarios in your head and you can't bear to think that someone -- your best friend, amazing husband, the father of my children -- went through any of that. I don't want that for him. It's the not knowing that really destroys you." The past 12 months have been a roller coaster of emotions for Weeks. Initially she thought the plane had crashed but when no debris appeared she clung on to hope. When the "pings" were discovered and authorities believed they would find the black boxes within days, she was told to prepare for her husband's memorial service. When that turned out to be wrong, her heart sank once again. Now there are days when her grief paralyzes her and she can't get out of bed. There are other days when she affords herself the small luxury of daydreaming and imagines him walking in the front door. "When I'm alone and I think 'what if he comes back?' I see our wedding pictures and I think if he was to come back it would be amazing (for me) and for the kids. Jack has grown so much -- he was 11 months when Paul left. We're coming up to his second birthday. "We've gone through all the 12 months of special days and I look at Jack and he's the spitting image of Paul. He would be blown away by how much he's grown. He should be here seeing all of that and the reason we don't know why is so painful. "I can't even explain the pain -- it's unbearable." We discuss the current search underway in the southern Indian Ocean more than 1,000 miles from where we are sitting in her home. Weeks looks deflated -- she's physically, mentally and emotionally exhausted. "They're very optimistic about this latest search. I can't share in that anymore. I've thrown my emotions and hopes into so many other searches. It's too much for me now. I won't come back. Half of my soul was on that plane with Paul and now nearly a year on ... I don't think I will ever find myself again." Week's eyes well up with tears as she talks about her husband whom she met at the Munich Beer Festival 15 years ago. Since then, they had been inseparable --  until now. Her greatest fear is if nothing is found in the 60,000 square kilometer priority search area -- due to be completed by May - the authorities will call off the search operation. No country has said this but it doesn't stop Danica from thinking it. "You know, that's so unfair -- where does that leave us? We can't move on beyond MH370. They may be able to but they don't come home to an empty house and 2 young children that should have their father here. They (the Malaysians) are legally and morally committed to bringing them all home and that's what they should do". When asked what she'll be doing on March 8 -- one year since MH370 disappeared and since she last saw Paul -- tears stream down her face. "Probably crying a lot. I never thought we'd reach a year and not know. You go through every anniversary, Lincoln's birthday, Paul's birthday, Christmas. You think we'll know by then and it's a year on." While her loss and pain is palpable, there is an incredible strength within Weeks. She has to remain strong, she says, for the sake of her boys. "I will keep searching. I will never stop searching for him. He gave everything to us. He is amazing. I know that if the shoe was on the other foot, he wouldn't stop looking for me. "And I will never stop looking for him either."

(CNN)Even if you're sweating on the treadmill and grunting at the weight machine, you're probably still forgetting 57 important muscles that define part of who you are and how others perceive you and even help manage your mental well-being. They're in your face. Face Love Fitness, a pop-up boutique in downtown Manhattan, offers face workouts and massages to keep the skin and muscles of the face and neck healthy, looking young and feeling good. "The popular notion that one should avoid touching one's face for fear of creating wrinkles is completely incorrect. Skin responds beautifully to mindful touch," says Rachel Lang, an esthetician (skin care therapist), who co-founded the Face Love skin gym with massage therapist Heidi Frederick and personal trainer Kate Gyllenhaal. Not all skin experts agree. Some dermatologists, including Dr. Patricia K. Farris, a clinical associate professor at Tulane University, say that exercising facial muscles is counterintuitive to dermatologists. They treat lines and wrinkles caused by facial muscle movement, called dynamic wrinkles, with the muscle relaxing medication botulinum toxin, commonly known by the brand name "Botox." "I do think there could be some value to relaxation and stress relief provided by massage, but exercising facial muscles will not make you look younger and may even make you look older," says Farris. But proponents of massage say healthy, youthful skin is well-worked skin. "When you stimulate pressure receptors under the skin, as you do in a moderate pressure massage, you increase the temperature of the skin, you slow down the physiology, you reduce the release of stress hormones and enhance immune function" according to Tiffany Field, Ph.D., director of the Touch Research Institute at the University of Miami School of Medicine. "Just as massage and exercise contributes to health in general, it would also be expected to contribute to skin health." This is the philosophy at the skin gym, where they say the massage and movement is detoxifying and increases oxygen and blood circulation to the skin, which can result in fewer wrinkles, a firmer jaw line, improved skin tone, and even reduced headaches and eyestrain, according to Lang. "It is like any exercise, you need to do it two to three times a week for the best results." It may look a little silly, contorting your facial expressions as Lang drags a plastic roller across your face, or trying to lift your eyebrows against the resistance of an elastic band across your forehead, but the effect of working out your face is pleasantly refreshing. Under the skin there is an area of fatty tissue called the subcutaneous layer. It diminishes with age. The loss of this area contributes to decreased firmness, giving facial skin an older, tired look. Exercising the facial muscles tones and lifts the skin because your facial muscles are attached to your skin and the bone like a web that forms the shape of your face. Through the massages and resistance training, Face Love Fitness claims muscles in the face become stronger and taut, rejuvenating the appearance of the face. "This is great for everyone, it doesn't matter what age or gender or skin type. This is beauty and health anti-aging from the inside out. It supports and amplifies whatever routine you already have and will give you positive results regardless of your skin condition," says Lang. "Because it refreshes and detoxifies, the massages are also good for hangovers," she adds. "We all know that keeping the body fit with exercise is essential. Why do we stop at the neck?!" asks Gyllenhaal.
(CNN)As long as 7,000 years ago, the Chinchorro people who lived along the desert coast of what is now Chile and Peru were mummifying the bodies of those who died. But, after millennia in which the mummies have remained well preserved, those ancient remains are now in danger of rapid decomposition, Harvard scientists have warned. The culprit? According to the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, in a news report published Monday, rising humidity that helps microbes flourish on the mummies' skin is to blame. As a result, scientists at the University of Tarapaca's archeological museum in Arica, northern Chile, have already seen some of its 120 prized examples of Chinchorro mummies start turning into a "black ooze," it said. Egypt dig unearths 3,600-year-old mummy . The role of rising humidity was confirmed through testing on skin samples by Harvard professor Ralph Mitchell and researcher Alice DeAraujo, according to the news release. Their findings will help conservationists in Arica -- an arid area where humidity levels have been increasing in recent years -- safeguard their precious relics. Egypt's mummies get CT scans . But Mitchell said he was concerned about potentially hundreds more mummies buried just below the sandy surface in the valleys of northern Chile. "You have these bodies out there and you're asking the question: How do I stop them from decomposing? It's almost a forensic problem," he is quoted as saying. A "complicated process" was used to prepare the mummies, said Marcela Sepulveda, professor of archaeology at the University of Tarapaca, cited in the news release. It involved removing the brain and organs, replacing them with natural fiber and ash, stitching the body back up with reeds and covering the skin with a paste of manganese, ocher or brown mud, depending on the period. The Chinchorro people mummified human remains for more than 3,000 years. The oldest of the mummies date back some 2,000 years before the ancient Egyptians mummified their pharaohs.

(CNN)Five full weeks into Aaron Hernandez's murder trial, prosecutors have called 77 witnesses. Jurors have yet to hear from the former NFL star's fiancée, Shayanna Jenkins, New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick or owner Robert Kraft. But this week did bring emotional testimony and important developments in the case against Hernandez, who has pleaded not guilty to killing Odin Lloyd in 2013. Check out some of the key moments you might have missed this week. A DNA analyst from the Massachusetts State Police crime lab said she found that Hernandez's DNA matched the DNA taken from a marijuana joint found near Lloyd's body at the crime scene. Lloyd's DNA also was found on the blunt. The DNA analyst, Diane Biagiotti, testified to finding a partial DNA match from Hernandez on the shell casing found in the dumpster of the Enterprise rental car office. But under cross-examination, lead defense attorney Jamie Sultan got Biagiotti to acknowledge there's a high likelihood that DNA from chewing gum could have transferred to the shell casing found in the dumpster. The office manager at the rental car office, Keelia Smyth, testified that she put the shell casing and the gum together after finding the items in the Nissan Altima returned by Hernandez on June 17, 2013. She said she threw them in the trash bin outside of her office. Inside Hernandez's downward spiral . It was revealed by Sultan that the state never submitted the gum for DNA testing. The state has not yet explained why. We may hear the answer during the state's redirect of Biagiotti on Monday. Hernandez is seen on surveillance video buying gum, and he also offered some to Smyth. Biagiotti said under cross-examination that it's highly unlikely to find DNA on any shell casing. One reason is because the heat from the gun wipes away any DNA, she said. The shell casings found at the crime scene did not have enough DNA on them to produce a DNA profile. Hernandez's family was in court on Friday after a week's absence. Hernandez's mother, Terri Hernandez, told CNN' that she thought Friday "went very well" for him. Testimony this week also focused on fingerprints from Hernandez and Lloyd that were found inside the rented Nissan Altima. The car also had fingerprints of Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz, who are also charged with killing Lloyd. They have pleaded not guilty and will be tried separately. State Trooper David Mackin, a fingerprint expert with the Massachusetts State Police crime scene services, reported finding the fingerprints of Wallace and Ortiz in a Chrysler 300 that Hernandez rented. Prosecutors call it the "getaway car," which was ultimately found abandoned in Bristol, Connecticut. But no prints were found on the .22-caliber gun recovered on the edge of a wooded area near Hernandez's home.  Hernandez is charged with illegal possession of that gun. In addition, no prints were found on any of the shell casings, including the casing found stuck to the blue bubblegum in the dumpster outside the Enterprise office. Another key find: tire treads of the rear passenger tire of the Altima matched a tire impression found at the crime scene, according to court testimony. Shaquilla Thibou, Lloyd's younger sister and the last family member to see him before he was killed, took the stand Monday. About an hour before his death, she said she watched him get into a silver Nissan Altima as she sat in a friend's car outside her home. Thibou, who was 19 at the time of her brother's killing, told jurors that when Lloyd first walked to the car, he opened the front passenger door. He stopped and then opened the back passenger door and entered the car. "The light came on and there was a shadow in the back seat," she said. Then she saw the Altima pull away. It was 2:32 a.m. Thirty minutes later, Thibou returned to her home and charged her dead phone. She noticed a text from her big brother. Thibou was not allowed to share with jurors what was said in those texts. The judge ruled there is not enough proof the text message meant Lloyd feared for his life, legally called "a dying declaration." That means that the jury did not hear that at 3:07 a.m., Lloyd texted his sister asking, "U saw who I'm with?" At 3:11 a.m he checked in again, texting "hello." Finally, at 3:19 a.m. Thibou answered, "my phone was dead who was that?" At 3:22 a.m., Lloyd responded, "Nfl." A minute later, he sent his last text, "just so u know." During grand jury testimony, Thibou admitted she thought her brother was bragging. When reliving the moment when police came to her home to tell her family that Lloyd had been shot to death, Thibou began to cry silently, wiping her tears after Assistant District Attorney William McCauley gave her a tissue. During cross-examination, defense attorney Michael Fee introduced a photo of Lloyd taken by Thibou. It showed Lloyd smiling and sitting in the driver's seat of the black Suburban that Hernandez loaned him. On Wednesday, jurors got an up-close view of the clothes Lloyd was wearing the night he was shot six times. Massachusetts crime lab forensic chemist Sherri Menendez held up Lloyd's bullet-riddled dark blue Old Navy sweatshirt and then his red plaid shirt.  Jurors craned their necks to get a better view of the bullet holes in the sweatshirt. The shirt was stained with blood. Menendez tested the bullet holes for gunshot residue consisting of what she described as burned particles and vaporous lead. During her testing of bullet holes on the front of the sweatshirt, she found both and was able to determine that Lloyd was shot from as close as 3 feet. The autopsy showed the final two shots were fired into his chest while he was laying face up in the ground. Just weeks before Hernandez was arrested and charged with murder, he toured rental apartments with New England Patriot employee Kevin Anderson, real estate agent Barbara Scardino testified Thursday. She said she was initially contacted by Anderson to find some apartments to show Hernandez.  He had previously called her to help other Patriot players find homes and apartment rentals, sometimes second residences near Gillette Stadium. This means the Patriot staff knew about Hernandez's second home. In early May of 2013, she showed Anderson and Hernandez four apartments.  Hernandez settled on the two-bedroom condo in Franklin, Massachusetts, referred to as his "flophouse." Hernandez's home in North Attleboro and his condo in Franklin are each about 15 minutes away from the stadium. Hernandez's Franklin neighbor, Carol Bailey, also took the stand, telling jurors that she met another man that also stayed in the condo. It was Hernandez's friend Wallace. Bailey paid close attention to Hernandez and Wallace, seeing them come and go during their short stay there. During her one attempt to talk to Hernandez and say hello, she says he sort of grunted back, calling it a "nondescript" noise.  She also testified that she often heard loud voices that sounded "locker room-ish" coming from the apartment as well as a strong "skunk-like" smell seeping into her apartment from their shared wall. After mid-June, she never saw him again. A representative from Sprint, Justin Darrow, started off the week with a light moment. He appeared nervous and stopped to take a moment while answering a question. He then turned to Judge Susan Garsh and apologized. "It's a big case. Sorry." Showing no emotion, Garsh struck the comment from the record. Darrow went on to testify to multiple calls between Sprint cell phone client Ernest Wallace and Odin Lloyd, Aaron Hernandez and Hernandez's fiancee, Shayanna Jenkins, the night before and morning of Lloyd's death. Prosecutors say they believe Hernandez was using his fiancee's phone to call Wallace. Jenkins granted immunity . Darrow also explained how cell sites (or towers) in the Sprint network tracked the phone calls, and thus tracked the direction they were driving. Another cell phone representative also testified. T-Mobile engineer Patrick Quinn testified about the data transmissions from Lloyd's cell phone beginning on June 17, 2013, at 2:32 a.m. That's when Lloyd was picked up outside his home in the Nissan Altima. Data transmissions are the automatic updates that are sent to cell phones. Assistant District Attorney Patrick Bomberg methodically walked Quinn through data transmissions received on Lloyd's cell phone via multiple cell towers along the route he traveled from Dorchester to the industrial park in North Attleboro. The last cell tower was just 400 yards from Lloyd's body.
(CNN)Families of children killed at the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut have filed lawsuits against the estate of the shooter's mother, saying Nancy Lanza was careless and negligent in leaving a Bushmaster AR-15 rifle unsecured in her home. Adam Lanza, 20, used the assault rifle to kill 20 first-grade students and six adults in Newtown on December 14, 2012. The younger Lanza was mentally unstable and used his mother's Bushmaster to kill her before he went on the rampage at the school, and then killed himself. At least eight lawsuits have been filed in Connecticut courts since January on behalf of relatives of 16 people killed in the massacre -- four adults and 12 children. Court documents also list two people who suffered serious injuries. In December, the parents of nine children killed at the mass shooting, along with one teacher who survived, filed a separate lawsuit against the businesses behind the Bushmaster rifle. Report finds missed chances to help Newtown shooter . The wrongful death lawsuit, filed one day after the second anniversary of the killings, named Camfour, a gun distributor; Riverview Gun Sales;  as well as the Freedom Group, the company that owns Bushmaster. It blamed the numerous lives lost in just 264 seconds on the shooter's weapon of choice, the Bushmaster. Koskoff Koskoff & Bieder, the law firm for the families in the Bushmaster lawsuit, is also representing some families in the cases against Lanza's estate. The lawsuits were first reported Friday in the Connecticut Post, which said Nancy Lanza is believed to have had insurance on the home worth more than $1 million. "Unlike our case against Bushmaster, Camfour (the distributor), and Riverview for the negligent entrustment and marketing of combat AR-15's designed for the military to inflict mass casualties against the enemy to civilians like Nancy Lanza, we expect this claim to be resolved quickly," attorney Josh Koskoff said of the estate lawsuits. The lawsuits claim that Nancy Lanza kept the rapid-fire Bushmaster in her home "unsecured" and that her "carelessness and negligence" contributed to the pain and suffering of the victims. A look at Newtown in 2013 . One lawsuit accused Lanza of allowing her son access to weapons "despite the fact that she knew, or should have known, that his mental and emotional condition made him a danger to others." The administrator of Nancy Lanza's estate, Samuel Starks, this month asked the courts for an extension to reply and asked that the cases needed to be consolidated. CNN's attempts to reach Starks were unsuccessful.
