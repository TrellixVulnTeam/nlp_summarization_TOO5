**Folder containing the code to create the Longformer Encoder Decoder (LED)**

The code in this folder is primarily based on the seq2seq modeling framework from [huggingface](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/master/examples/seq2seq) and the [Longbart library](https://github.com/patil-suraj/longbart).

The RED should be run by setting the ```model_variant=longbart``` when calling ```finetune.py```.
