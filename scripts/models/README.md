**Folder containing the models and architectures work for this thesis**

The code in this folder is primarily based on the seq2seq modeling framework from [huggingface](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/master/examples/seq2seq). 

```finetune.py``` is the entry point to running the scripts here. Some sample shell scripts are provided in ```sh_scripts```. These exhibit how to finetune the models and run eval using the test set.
