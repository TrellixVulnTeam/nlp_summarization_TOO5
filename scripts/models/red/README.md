**Folder containing the code to create the Reformer Encoder Decoder (RED)**

The code in this folder is primarily based on the seq2seq modeling framework from [huggingface](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/master/examples/seq2seq). 

The RED should be run by setting the ```model_variant=reformer_encoder_decoder``` when calling ```finetune.py```.
