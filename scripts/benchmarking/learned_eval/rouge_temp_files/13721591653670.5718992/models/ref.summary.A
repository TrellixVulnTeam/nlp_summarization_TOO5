Many of us are very particular about how strong we like our tea and coffee and the same applies to how hot it has to be. With this in mind , engineers have created a heated mug designed to keep the temperature ' just right ' from the first sip to the last drop. Called the nanoheat wireless heated Mug , the $ 39.99 (  26 ) gadget can maintain the temperature at around 71 ° C ( 160 ° F ) for up to 45 minutes - giving you plenty of time to drink it all. Scroll down for video. The $ 39.99 (  26 ) nanoheat wireless heated Mug is fitted with a rchargeable battery , nanoheater and heat sleeve. It can maintain the temperature of hot drinks at between 68 ° C and 71 ° C ( 155 and 160 ° F ) for up to 45 minutes - giving you plenty of time to drink to finish the beverage before its gets too cold. The goldilocks principle is a scientific term for when the state of something falls within certain margins , based on the Children 's story the three bears. This principle applies to the nanoheat wireless heated Mug and the margins in this case are between 68 ° C and 71 ° C ( 155 and 160 ° F ). The mug weighs a little over one pound ( 454G ) and can be charged wirelessly or using a traditional USB cord. The goldilocks principle is a scientific term for when the state of something falls within certain margins , based on the Children 's story the three bears. In the story , goldilocks finds a house owned by three bears. Each bear has their own preference for Porridge and beds and after testing all three she determines that one is too hot , one is too large and baby bear 's preference is ' just ' right. ' This principle applies to the nanoheat wireless heated Mug and the margins in this case are between 68 ° C and 71 ° C ( 155 and 160 ° F ). It was designed by michigan-based design HMI and Green Lama , currently raising funds on kickstarter to fund production of the Mug. The team has raised more than $ 48,900 (  32,330 ) of its $ 120,000 (  79,300 ) goal so far and backers can pre-order the mug for $ 30 (  20 ). If the campaign is successful , the mugs will start shipping in August this year , after which point they will retail for $ 39.99 (  26 ). GITA Bedi , President of Green Lama said : ' As an engineering consultant I have been working with innovators on a global basis helping integrate innovations and technologies into consumer products. ' During this period , working from home , I would regularly have cups of coffee. ' As I was working , the coffee would get cold after a few sips -LSB- and -RSB- I would have to throw the coffee away and leave work to get another cup. Even though I brewed eight to 10 cups , most went to Wast. The mug weighs a little over one pound ( 454g ) and can be used up to seven times before it needs to be recharged. A built-in timer automatically turns off the Mug if its not used for 30 minutes , to conserve energy. The mug is only available in white , but wireless charging plates are available in both white and black. ' I have tried all different types of mugs , cups and warming plates but they were very inefficient , clumsy and a waste of money. ' So in late 2013 I started working on a wireless heated coffee mug with a rechargeable battery. ' The nanoheat wireless heated Mug can be used up to seven times before it needs to be recharged and a built-in timer will automatically turn off the Mug if its not used for 30 minutes to conserve energy. Its rechargeable battery sits at the bottom of the Mug , below a nanoheater protected by a heatsleeve that covers the inside of the gadget. The mug is only available in white , but wireless charging plates are available in both white and black. smartqsine is the first wireless monitoring system for food and cooking supplies.items are placed in jars on the $ 39 (  26 ) smartqsine device.

An APP then lets homeowners check the precise amounts of anything in their kitchen using a smartphone or tablet , thanks to a built-in sensor pad. As food from the JAR is used up notifications are sent automatically to the phone to warn when its running low. Any food item can be used and calibrated with the pad and people can check the status of the jar at any point and while shopping , for example. The firm said : ' No more guesswork , N more over buying. Just check your smart device and get the exact amount you have left.
